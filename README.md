<li>Ethanol was first isolated from&nbsp;<a title="Wine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine">wine</a>&nbsp;in approximately 1100 and was found to burn shortly thereafter. These early solutions&nbsp;<a title="Distillation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation">distilled</a>&nbsp;from wine-salt mixtures were referred to as&nbsp;<em>aqua ardens</em>&nbsp;(burning water) or&nbsp;<em>aqua flamens</em>&nbsp;(flaming water) and had such low alcohol content that they burned without producing noticeable heat. By the 13th century, the development of the cooling coil allowed the isolation of nearly pure ethanol by distillation.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup></li>
<li>Ethanol has been used for&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Lamp oil" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamp_oil">lamp oil</a>&nbsp;and cooking, along with plant and animal oils.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;Small alcohol stoves (also called "<a class="mw-redirect" title="Spirit lamp" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_lamp">spirit lamps</a>") were commonly used by travelers in the 17th century to warm food and themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Before the&nbsp;<a title="American Civil War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">American Civil War</a></strong>&nbsp;many farmers in the United States had an alcohol&nbsp;<a title="Still" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still">still</a>&nbsp;to turn crop waste into free lamp oil and stove fuel for the farmers' family use.

<li>In the&nbsp;<strong>1830s,</strong>&nbsp;alcohol blends had replaced increasingly expensive whale oil in most parts of the country. It "easily took the lead as the illuminant" because it was "a decided improvement on other oils then in use."<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup></li>
<li>By&nbsp;<strong>1860,</strong>&nbsp;thousands of distilleries churned out at least 90&nbsp;million US gallons (340,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of alcohol per year for lighting. Camphene / alcohol blends (at $.50 per gallon) were cheaper than whale oil ($1.30 to $2.50 per gallon) and lard oil (90 cents per gallon). It was about the same price as coal oil, which was the product first marketed as "kerosene."<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"></sup></li>

Because gasoline is so cheap and abundant, and also because ethanol is taxed at a high level, early US automobiles are adapted to gasoline from the beginning. Racing cars, on the other hand, usually used ethanol (and other alcohols) because more power could be developed in a smaller, lighter engine.&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Charles Edgar Duryea" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Edgar_Duryea">Charles Edgar Duryea</a>&nbsp;builds the first U.S. gasoline powered car but is aware of Samuel Morey's ethanol fueled experimental car of 1826.&nbsp;<a title="Henry Ford" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford">Henry Ford</a>'s first car, the&nbsp;<a title="Quadracycle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadracycle">Quadracycle</a>, is also built that year.

<li>In&nbsp;<strong>1971</strong>, the&nbsp;<a class="new" title="Nebraska Agricultural Products Industrial Utilization (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nebraska_Agricultural_Products_Industrial_Utilization&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Nebraska Agricultural Products Industrial Utilization</a>&nbsp;Committee (or "Gasohol" Committee) is formed to find new uses for surplus grain. The commission tests ethanol-gasoline blends in thousands of cars over millions of miles, proving that ethanol can be used as an octane-boosting additive to replace leaded gasoline.</li>
<li>In&nbsp;<strong>1973</strong>, the&nbsp;<a title="1973 oil crisis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis">Arab oil embargo</a>&nbsp;creates a worldwide energy crisis, leading to intensified search for alternative energy sources. Also, in the same year, the government of Brazil starts the program "Pr&oacute;-&Aacute;lcool" in order to substitute gas-powered vehicles in favor of automobiles powered by ethanol. Such program would lead to the development of the first ethanol powered automobile motor in the world.</li>
<li>In&nbsp;<strong>1979</strong>, President&nbsp;<a title="Jimmy Carter" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>'s administration creates federal incentives for ethanol production. Federal and state subsidies for ethanol amount to about $11 billion between 1979 and 2000, as compared to about $150 billion in tax credits for the oil industry (from 1968&ndash;2000), according to the General Accounting Office.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"></sup></li>
<li>By the&nbsp;<strong>mid-1980s</strong>, over 100 new corn alcohol production plants are built and over a billion US gallons of ethanol for fuel were sold per year. The ethanol program is controversial for several reasons, not the least of which was that the ethanol industry was dominated by one company &ndash;&nbsp;<a title="Archer Daniels Midland" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_Daniels_Midland">Archer Daniels Midland</a>&nbsp;of Peoria, Ill.</li>
<li>In&nbsp;<strong>1984</strong>, the number of ethanol plants peaked at 163 in the U.S., producing 595&nbsp;million US gallons (2,250,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of ethanol that year.</li>
<li>In 1988, the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="George H. W. Bush administration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush_administration">George H. W. Bush administration</a>&nbsp;proposes a cleanup of "air toxics" in gasoline, focusing on replacing benzene octane boosters with ethanol. The proposal leads to one part of the 1990&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Clean Air Act (United States)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)">Clean Air Act</a>.</li>
<li>In the late&nbsp;<strong>1980s</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>1990s</strong>, an oil surplus drives gasoline prices down as low as $12 per barrel, driving most of the ethanol industry into bankruptcy.</li>
<li>In&nbsp;<strong>1990</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>1992</strong>, Congress passes amendments to the Clean Air Act encouraging the use of ethanol and other oxygenated fuels as replacements for benzene,&nbsp;<a title="Toluene" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene">toluene</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Xylene" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylene">xylene</a>&nbsp;octane boosters.&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="MTBE" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTBE">MTBE</a>&nbsp;becomes the oil industry's favorite additive, but as water pollution problems were recognized, MTBE is banned in California. Ethanol production rises to the 4-billion-US-gallon (15,000,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) level.</li>
<li>Between&nbsp;<strong>1997</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2002</strong>, three million U.S. cars and light trucks are produced which could run on&nbsp;<a title="E85" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E85">E85</a>, a blend of 85% ethanol with 15% gasoline. Almost no gas stations sell this fuel however.</li>
<li>In the early&nbsp;<strong>2000s</strong>, the&nbsp;<a title="2003 invasion of Iraq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a>&nbsp;makes Americans aware of their dependence on foreign oil. This and worry over anthropogenic&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Climate change" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">climate change</a>&nbsp;causes leading alternative energies like&nbsp;<a title="Biofuel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofuel">biofuel</a>, solar and wind to expand 20 to 30% yearly.</li>
<li>In&nbsp;<strong>2003</strong>, California is the first state to ban MTBE. Several other states start switching soon afterward. California consumes 900&nbsp;million US gallons (3,400,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of ethanol a year, about a third of all the ethanol produced in the United States.</li>
<li>In&nbsp;<strong>2004</strong>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Crude oil" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil">Crude oil</a>&nbsp;prices rise by 80%. Gasoline prices rise 30% in the U.S.&nbsp;<a title="Diesel fuel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel">Diesel fuel</a>&nbsp;rises almost 50%. These rises are caused by&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Hurricane" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane">hurricane</a>&nbsp;damage to oil rigs in the&nbsp;<a title="Gulf of Mexico" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, attacks on&nbsp;<a title="Iraq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq">Iraqi</a>&nbsp;oil pipelines, disruptions elsewhere, and rising demand for gasoline in&nbsp;<a title="Asia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia">Asia</a>, as Asians buy more cars. Alcohol fuel prices are much closer to the price of gasoline. The ethanol industry in the USA makes 225,000 barrels (35,800&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) per day in August, an all-time record. Some conventional oil fuel companies are investing in alcohol fuel.&nbsp;<a title="Oil reserves" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves">Oil reserves</a>&nbsp;are forecast to last about 40 more years. Total use (demand) of ethanol is 3.53&nbsp;billion US gallons (13,400,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>).</li>
<li>In&nbsp;<strong>2005</strong>, E85 sells for 45 cents (or 30-75 cents wholesale) less than gasoline on average in the United States. More than 4 million&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Flexible fuel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_fuel">flexible-fuel</a>&nbsp;(capable of running on E85 as well as gasoline) vehicles exist in the United States. About 400 filling stations exist in the US that sell E85 fuel, mostly in the Midwest. Gasoline prices rise as ethanol prices stay the same, due to rapidly growing ethanol supply and federal tax subsidies for ethanol. Wholesale ethanol prices drop nearly 30% between January and April, or $1.75 to $1.23 per gallon in the U.S.</li>
